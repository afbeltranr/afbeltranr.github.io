    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of data science, I’m deeply interested in philosophy, punk music, and language learning.
      I’ve recently started learning French with a focus on conversational fluency and reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also passionate about empowering others through education, learning theory, and collaborative exploration of ideas across disciplines. Music, especially the energy of punk, is a source of both creativity and resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that creativity in data work is often inspired by diverse experiences, and I strive to maintain a balance between deep technical learning and humanistic exploration.
